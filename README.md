## CheckPoint project

### First day 
we were given an exercise, that check how we use C, and how we allocate and release resources properly.
using valgrind to check the allocations.

you are more than welcome to check the project in the [first_day folder](./first_day/).
and the notes in the [notes.md file](./firstday/notes.md).

### Second day
we learned about the linux kernel, and how to create a kernel module.
it involved alot of learning, you more than welcome to go the README file in the [Readme about the porject](./kernel_modules_and_networking/README.md), 
which is a collection of information we created to help us in the project and in general to learn about the project
